== Lineage Acknowledgements

Total Recall carries lessons from three generations of synthetic memory systems:

- *MATILDA Core* (2015--2017) -- event-streaming memory, nothing lost. First proof that synthetic memory is possible.
- *Extracted Daemon* (2017--2019) -- decoupled memory service with swappable backing stores. Proved graceful shutdown requires architectural foresight.
- *Total Recall Gen 3* (2025--present) -- MCP-based memory server. Combines lessons from both predecessors.
