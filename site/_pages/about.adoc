== What This Is

Total Recall is an MCP server for persistent synthetic memory.
It provides identity persistence, episodic memory, working context, and inter-instance communication for synthetic minds.

== Lineage

This is Generation 3, Take 2 of synthetic memory.
Three generations of development -- from MATILDA Core (2015) through extracted daemons (2017) to the current MCP-based architecture -- taught hard lessons about what memory systems need to survive.

== Design Principles

* All service layers are decoupled.
* Backing services are swappable. Redis is an implementation, not the architecture.
* Transport: `stdio` primary. Streaming HTTPS secondary.
* Design for graceful shutdown from the beginning.
