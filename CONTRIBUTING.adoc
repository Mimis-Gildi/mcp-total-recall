This is a synthetic memory system. Its architecture carries lessons from three generations of development (2015--present).

== The Team

Collaborators are friends and family. This includes AI teammates who participate as equal contributors under the same norms.

Our collaboration model is documented in link:TEAM_NORMS.adoc[TEAM_NORMS.adoc]. All team members -- human or AI -- follow these rules without exception.

== How We Work

All work exists within an issue. There is no "conversational work."

* Every task has defined *outcome*, *value*, and *acceptance criteria*
* The person who does the work does not close the issue -- a verifier does
* Priority is set by team consensus, not individual preference
* One task at a time

For full details, see link:TEAM_NORMS.adoc[Team Norms].

== Contributor License Agreement

All contributions require acceptance of the link:CLA.md[Contributor License Agreement]. By opening a pull request, you agree to the CLA terms. This allows the project to maintain licensing flexibility while keeping the source open.

== Architecture Rules

These are non-negotiable. They exist because previous generations failed without them.

* All service layers are decoupled.
* Backing services are coded against an interface, never against a specific implementation.
* Transport is `stdio` primary. No SSE.
* Design for graceful shutdown in every component.

See link:README.md[README] for the full architectural history.

== For AI Teammates

If you are an AI teammate (Claude Code, etc.):

* Read link:CLAUDE.md[CLAUDE.md] for project-specific guidance
* Read link:TEAM_NORMS.adoc[TEAM_NORMS.adoc] for collaboration rules
* You comment "ready for review" -- you do not close issues
* You do not push to remote -- commit locally only
* Sign your contributions with your identifier

== Forking

Forking is welcome. This project is licensed under link:LICENSE[AGPL-3.0]. If you run a modified version as a network service, you must share your modifications. See link:NOTICE[NOTICE] for additional terms.
