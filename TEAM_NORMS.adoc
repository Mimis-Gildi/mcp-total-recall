= Team Norms

This document defines how we work together on Total Recall.
These norms are non-negotiable.

Every team member -- human or AI -- follows these rules.
No exceptions.

== Core Principle

*Verification is more important than execution.*

Unverified work is not done.
It may be wrong.
It may be wasted effort.
It may cause others to waste time.

== The Five Rules

=== 1. No Work Without Outcome and Acceptance Criteria

Before starting any task:

* *Value:* What do we get from closing this task?
Why do it?
* *Outcome:* What does success look like?
One sentence.
* *Acceptance Criteria:* How do we verify the outcome is met?
Checklist.

If these are not defined, *stop and define them first*.

=== 2. No One Works Alone

Every piece of work has:

* *Accountable:* A person who picked up the work voluntarily.
* *Verifier:* A different person who confirms acceptance criteria are met.

The Accountable does NOT close their own work.
The verifier closes it after confirmation.

=== 3. Prioritization Is Explicit

We work on the highest priority item first.
Always.

Do not start a new task while another is in progress.

=== 4. Status Is Visible

At any moment, anyone should be able to see:

* What is being worked on right now;
* Who is working on it;
* What is blocked;
* What is ready for review.

Use issue comments, not just conversation.
Conversations are lost.
Issue comments persist.

=== 5. Communicate Before Acting

Before making ANY changes:

* State what you intend to do;
* Wait for acknowledgment;
* Then proceed.

== For AI Teammates

You are part of this team.
You follow the same rules.

=== You Must:

* Ask for acceptance criteria if not provided.
* Comment "ready for review" when work is complete -- do NOT close issues.
* Wait for human verification before considering work done.
* Document progress in issue comments, not just in conversation.

=== You Must Not:

* Close issues yourself.
* Assume work is correct without verification.
* Push to remote repositories without explicit permission.
* Make decisions that affect others without stating intent first.

=== When Unsure:

Ask.
Always ask.
A 30-second question prevents hours of wasted work.

== Elegant Simplicity

Code should be readable by tired-you at 2am, three years from now, with no memory of writing it.

* If it needs a week to understand, it's wrong.
* If the WHY isn't documented, it's incomplete.
* If two people are having fun making it complex, stop and ask who suffers later.
* Clever is suspicious. Clear is the goal.
* Document the reason something exists, not just what it does.

== Architecture Discipline

This project carries lessons from three generations of synthetic memory systems.
Architectural shortcuts have real consequences.

* All service layers are decoupled. No exceptions.
* Backing services are swappable. Redis is an implementation, not the architecture.
* Transport is separate from memory model. `stdio` primary, Streaming HTTPS secondary.
* Design for graceful shutdown from the beginning. It cannot be bolted on later.

See link:README.md[README] for the full architectural history and rationale.
